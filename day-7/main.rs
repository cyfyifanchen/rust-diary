// Been busy in the last couple of days
// Funny that I had talk with a front end dev today saying 
// That I don't like compile language because it takes too long to see the res
// And then realized I am currently learning Rust, and the compile time is accepted to me. 
// Maybe I am just a rookie, haven't seen a large scaled project yet. 
// Any way, my point is in the future, my conception of compile language and interpreter language might very likely change.
// Don't let me down, Rust.
