## Install

Well, that recommended downloader, `restup` is slow, I hope it works, operation timed out. Found 2 relative issues on Github, but not seeing a valid solution. I wish it's not something wrong with my network. Don't know why, moving on, trying `brew install rust` hope it works.

Hmm, brew takes a long time...

failed to download

Got stuck, will come back later.
